            <h2>Warning</h2>
            <h3>
                Only use wallets that allow you to receive Bitcoin from the same address you sent from. If you're not sure, test by sending a bet for the minimum amount. If you get nothing back, then your wallet is not compatible. Note that some bets may require one confirmation before the win/loss value is sent back.

            <ul>
                <li>{{'_ColumnRightli1_' | i18n}}</li>
                <li>{{'_ColumnRightli2_' | i18n}}</li>

            </ul>   
            <p>
                Your bet is evaluated when our system receives your bet transaction. Your payout transaction is built using the output of your bet transaction. Therefore, if your bet transaction fails, the payout transaction also fails.
            <br>
            Play by sending BTC to a game address in the Games tab.  There is a consolation prize of your bet * 0.005. If you win, your winnings equals your bet * the prize multiplier for your game.
            <br>
            Every bet receives an answering transaction which spends the output of your bet transaction. The transaction fee for is subtracted from your winnings or the consolation prize.</p>

            <h4>Transaction Processing Time</h4>

            <p>A transaction fee of .0005 is recommended. Sometimes there is a delay in processing bets. Every bet uses the date that our system is first made aware of the bet, so that your lucky number doesn't change if our system cannot process your bet.</p>

            <h4>Min / Max Bets</h4>

            <p>Any bets less than the minimum bet (.01 BTC) or higher than the maximum bet (which is determined separately for each game) is considered an invalid bet, and will be returned, minus the transaction fee.</p>

            <h4>Minimum Payments</h4>

            <p>If the payment amount is less than 5460 satoshi, the payment is set to 0.00005460.</p>

            <h3>Advanced Tips</h3>
            <h4>Multiple bets per transaction</h4>
            <p>To place multiple bets in one transaction, you can use your wallet to send to several different bet addresses at once. Each individual bet will have a different lucky number.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Custom withdrawal addresses</h4>
            <p>Normally, when you send a bet, the return payment is sent back to the same Bitcoin address you sent from. However, there is a way to have the return payment sent to a new, custom address.
            </p>    
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you add an additional payment to your bet transaction, sending exactly 0.0051999 BTC to a separate address, the payout for the bet will go to that address.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In Bitcoin-QT, this is done by clicking the 'Add recipient...' button.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The first payment in the transaction must go to BetCoin Dice with your bet amount, and the second payment in the transaction must go to [yournewaddress] with the amount of 0.0051999. If you win, all the money will then be sent to [yournewaddress].
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Verification</h2>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <h4>Secret Keys</h4>
            <p>
                In order to ensure that there is no way for the system to change the outcome of a bet, the secret keys used are decided ahead of time. They are not released right away, since they could be used to submit selective transactions and win bets unfairly. However, the hash of the secrets is released. After the secrets are release users can verify that preceding bets were provably fair.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Days</h4>
            <p> 
                Each bet transaction that comes in is assigned to the secret key of the current day when it is first processed. In most cases this will be as soon as the transaction is broadcast on the bitcoin network. However it could be later if the system has some problems processing or an outage. All times are in GMT
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Hash File</h4>
            <p> 
                The system has a file of all the hash keys for the next 10 years: <a href="https://api.betcoin.tm/hashes.keys">hashes.keys</a>
                This file can be verified in several ways. The simplest is to simply download and keep a copy of that file.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Secrets</h4>
            <p> 
                Every 24 hours the system will allow access to the previous day's secret. Then the code below can be used to verify each game was provably fair. A list of secrets for previous days can be found here:
                <a href="https://api.betcoin.tm/secret.keys">secret.keys</a>
            </p>
